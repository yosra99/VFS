Virtual File System
Assume that you have a virtual file system with a root directory called "root" all the files and folders will be stored under it. The disk size consists of N blocks and each block size is 1 KB.
The aim of this assignment is to simulate the allocation and de-allocation of files and folders using different allocation techniques. You should implement the three allocation techniques listed below (Refer to the file system chapter in your text book):
1. Contiguous Allocation (Using worst Fit allocation)
2. Linked Allocation
3. Indexed Allocation
